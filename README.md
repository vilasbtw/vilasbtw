# üëã Hi there 

I am Kaique Vilas Boa, a problem-solving and curious Software Developer eager to join projects that will enhance my programming skills. I currently work as an IT intern at Unicamp in the Technical Support area. I am actively seeking an opportunity in backend development, where I can gain practical experience and contribute to challenging projects. I am also in my third semester of Systems Analysis and Development at Instituto Federal de S√£o Paulo.
