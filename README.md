# 👋 Hi there 

I am Kaique Vilas Boa, a problem-solving and curious Software Developer eager to join projects that will enhance my programming skills. At the moment, I am seeking a job opportunity to gain hands-on experience with the Spring Boot framework and back-end development. 

Feel free to contact me on my LinkedIn for networking or if you have an opportunity where I can contribute!

# Technical Expertise:

I have a strong foundation in logic, unit testing, data structures, and algorithms. I also have hands-on experience developing RESTful APIs and CLIs, with a focus on organization, clarity, and scalability.

I have practical experience with Go, having built a software to configure freshly formatted PCs from Unicamp and   experience with Spring Boot, developing a RESTful API using JWT, DTOs, Flyway, Swagger, and full test coverage. Always aiming for clean and scalable code.
